# EEEM068 LSA Viva Notes

## 1. Research problem

### Why is melanoma classification challenging?

- Severe class imbalance.
- False-negative melanoma predictions are important.
- Multiple images may originate from the same patient.
- Clinical metadata may provide information complementary to images.

---

## 2. Validation

### Why use patient-aware splitting?

Patient-aware splitting prevents observations belonging to the
same patient from appearing in both training and validation data.

This reduces the risk of information leakage and provides a more
realistic estimate of performance on unseen patients.

### What is patient leakage?

Patient leakage occurs when images belonging to the same
patient appear in both training and validation data.

A model may then exploit patient-specific similarities,
making validation performance appear better than its
performance on genuinely unseen patients.

### How was it prevented?

I used StratifiedGroupKFold.

- `target` was used for stratification.
- `patient_id` was used as the grouping variable.
- Five folds were generated.
- Fold 0 was used as the fixed validation set.
- The same split was used for every model.
- Known patient overlap between training and validation
  was explicitly verified to be zero.

### Did I perform full five-fold cross-validation?

No.

Five patient-aware folds were generated to define a
reproducible grouped partition, but only Fold 0 was used
as the held-out validation set for the LSA experiments.

This was done to maintain a common validation set across
experiments while keeping training computationally feasible.
